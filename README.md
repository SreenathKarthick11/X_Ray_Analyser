# X_Ray_Analyser
 this our group project for 1st year in programming python

# OBJECTIVE OF PROJECT
# Our aim is to make a machine learning model that helps us classify
# X-rays that have fractures against those which don't have fracture image
# classification. Helping us to identify whether the X-Ray image is fractured
# or not ,and also recognising which part of the body the image belongs to.
# By doing so, we are able to effectively recognize the existence of fracture
# along with the body part involved.

# We also aim to make a website which will run the pre-saved machine
# learning model, for fracture image classification.

# Team Members and Contributions:

# i. M Murali Karthick:
# Worked on Image Classification (Making of Dataset) and all the CNN
# Models such as (CNN , VGG16 , DenseNet21 , ResNet101 , MobileNet ,
# GoogleNet (Inception), also on failed models of ResNet50 and EfficientNet)

# ii. M Sreenath Karthick:
# Worked on Canny Edge Detection and Creation of Webpage using
# Flask and HTML , Developed on both frontend and backend, and the User Interface.

# iii. Aakash Kiran:
# Worked on Image Preprocessing and Machine Learning Models such
# as SVM , DecisionTree , Gaussian Naive Bayes , k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbours) , Random Forests .
